This tool grabs player data from the match report presented on
http://www.whoscored.com. Currently the user needs to provide a path to the
'Match Center'>'Player Statistics' page of any given game. The parser output is
a dictionary keyed by the uid of the player which points to a further
subdictionary consisting of the players stats.

Usage:
  $ python get_player_stats.py -u <uri> -u <another_uri>

Tests:
  All tests depend on the python mox module (http://code.google.com/p/pymox/)
